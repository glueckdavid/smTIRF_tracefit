# smTIRF_tracefit (Michael Kirchmeyr, David Gl√ºck)
Shared repository for upload, discussion and troubleshooting of smTIRF scripts.

This ReadMe-file serves as a notepad for project goals, problems and points of discussion.
Edit and directly commit this file to post any comments or bulletpoints.

Project goals:
- 
- Ingestion of single molecule trace files created by the Oxford Nanoimager
- Conversion of traces according to global parameters
- Automated estimation of local parameters (blinking- and bleaching-events)
- Application of local parameters (categorization according to groups, truncation of traces before blinking/bleaching)
- Visualization of datasets (trace-wise with/without applied parameters, global histograms)
- Fitting of step function to individual traces (see github.com/LandesLab for implementation in MatLab)
- Creation of FRET-Histograms with variable bin sizes (see matplotlib documentation for matplotlib.pyplot.hist)
- Fitting of 1-5gaussian functions to histograms
- Saving of output-data for converted traces, local parameters, Trace fitting levels, histogram data, fit data
- Saving of relevant plots with annotation

Tips/general notes:
-
- rely on smaller functions whenever possible. This helps to track down bugs and facilitates patching of bugs/improvement of routines
- Break up the code in several files for better stability. Output-files in form of csv or json-dumps can be written and read easily and act as checkpoints between scripts
- Try to rely on as few modules as possble. It is easy to introduce bugs and unexpected behaviour by foreign modules.
- Do not hesistate to delete old code. It is often faster to re-write a section than to fix clunky code. GitHub-branches make this easier, if you fear to lose progress.
- Let loops and conditionals communicate by frequent print-outputs.
- Always ask for help if you get stuck. We are no programmers and learn by sharing and discussing even the smallest details.
